The k-means clustering algorithm was my central topic for my final project for CS 2810 Mathematics of Data Models at Northeastern University in the Fall 2021 semester. I was getting to learn some of the basics of unsupervised/supervised machine learning and data mining through this project. I hope to see growth in my knowledge and application of machine learning and data mining in my future career-based and personal endeavors.
